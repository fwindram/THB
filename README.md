ls/?id=835061601) - The original challenge XML guide.TopHotBot (THB) is a reddit bot written in python.
It is designed to poll for new threads to AskReddit every 10 minutes and then track them for a full 24 hours.

### Notes
The theoretical maximum threads being tracked at once is 2880 threads.
However it may be prudent to reduce this if it takes too long to run the script due to rate limits.
