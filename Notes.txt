Will need to pull from the JSON:
    - permalink     - String
    - id            - String
    - score         - int
    - num_comments  - int
    - created_utc   - long

Process:
    - Find current score & comments for all currently watched posts and append to data string
        - If current time (int(time.time()) - created_utc > 86400, post is stale and must be archived
            - Append to archive file and remove line from working file.
        - get submission details with submission = reddit.submission(id='******') and append to data string
    - Pull newest 20 posts
    - For each post check whether they are already being watched
    - If not, add them along with initial values to watch file
