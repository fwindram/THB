Will need to pull from reddit:
    - permalink     - String
    - id            - String
    - score         - int
    - num_comments  - int
    - created_utc   - long

Process:
    - Find current score & comments for all currently watched posts and append to data string
        - If current time (int(time.time()) - created_utc > 86400, post is stale and must be archived
            - Append to archive file and remove line from working file.
        - get submission details with submission = reddit.submission(id='******') and append to data string
    - Pull newest 20 posts
    - For each post check whether they are already being watched
    - If not, add them along with initial values to watch file

It may be prudent to limit THB to tracking 500 threads at once (this is because theoretically the max requests in 10 minutes is 600)
This could be performed with automatic submission request throttling:
i.e. if 250 threads are currently being watched, the threads arg passed to get_newthreads could be reduced to 10.
Alternatively the threads requested could be found by threads = min(int((500-len(watchedfile))/500*20),1)
In this case:
0 watched = 20 requested
250 watched = 10 requested
